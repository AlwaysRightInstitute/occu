CPU Support
===========

The HM-OCCU-SDK contains several binary packages for different CPU architectures. 
The CPU architectures are tested on the following hardware:

subfolder arm-gnueabihf: 
- Raspberry Pi 
- Cubietruck (Cubian)

subfolder X86_32:
- Debian Wheezy

subfolder mips:
- vu+ soloÂ² with vti Image

The script install.sh in the cpu specific subfolder copies all binary packages to /opt/hm. 
This script is just an example and may be enhanced by the community. Some Linux distributions
like openelec have a readonly root filesystem, so the installation script must be changed
(replace /opt/hm by /storage/hm).

Further CPU specific information can be found in the CPU architecture specific subfolder.

Binary Packages
=============== 
Each CPU subfolder contains the following binary packages:

- subfolder packages-eQ-3/RFD: Radio Frequence Daemon 
- subfolder packages-eQ-3/HS485D: (wired) HS485 Daemon
- subfolder packages-eQ-3/WebUI: pre alpha many CCU2 specific functions must be replace
- subfolder packages/lighttpd: preconfigured http daemon

CCU2 Toolchain
==============
With the CCU2 toolchain it is possible to compile C/C++ programms and build installable CCU2 Addons. 
It is also possible to build CCU2 Images with additional software, e.g. Email Addon, 
which can be installed as normal CCU2 updates. A tutorial haw to create a customized CCU2 Image 
will be published after the "HomeMatic User Treffen 2015" (18./19. April).
